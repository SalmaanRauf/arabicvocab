# UX Documentation

This folder contains the UX reference for the app. Start here, then follow links to detailed specs.

## Documents
- `docs/ux/UX_OVERVIEW.md` — Information architecture, navigation, flows, design direction, tokens, and screen-by-screen wireframe specs.
- `docs/ux/COMPONENT_SPECS.md` — Reusable component specs, variants, states, sizing, spacing, and accessibility constraints.

## How To Use
1. Read `UX_OVERVIEW.md` for the global UX model and screen layouts.
2. Use `COMPONENT_SPECS.md` as the implementation checklist for reusable components.
3. Keep any UI changes aligned to the tokens and interaction states defined here.
