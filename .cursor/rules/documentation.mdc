# Documentation Skill

When invoked with `@document`, generate appropriate documentation.

## Documentation Types

### Code Documentation

#### Class Documentation
```dart
/// A widget that displays an Arabic word with optional translation.
/// 
/// This widget handles RTL text direction automatically and supports
/// tapping to show word details.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// WordChip(
///   word: word,
///   onTap: () => showDetails(word),
/// )
/// ```
class WordChip extends StatelessWidget {
```

#### Method Documentation
```dart
/// Calculates the next review date based on FSRS algorithm.
/// 
/// [card] - The current card state with difficulty and stability.
/// [rating] - User's rating: 1 (Again), 2 (Hard), 3 (Good), 4 (Easy).
/// 
/// Returns a [SchedulingInfo] with the updated card state and next review.
/// 
/// Throws [ArgumentError] if rating is not between 1 and 4.
SchedulingInfo schedule(Card card, int rating) {
```

#### Provider Documentation
```dart
/// Provides the list of surahs with their metadata.
/// 
/// This is a cached provider that fetches data once from the repository.
/// Use [ref.invalidate] to force a refresh.
/// 
/// See also:
/// - [currentSurahProvider] for the selected surah
/// - [ayahsProvider] for verses in a surah
@riverpod
Future<List<Surah>> surahs(SurahsRef ref) async {
```

/// from the local SQLite database.
///

/// ```dart
/// final repo = QuranRepository(database);
/// final surahs = await repo.getSurahs();
/// ```
abstract class QuranRepository {
  /// Returns all 114 surahs ordered by surah number.
  Future<List<Surah>> getSurahs();
  
  /// Returns ayahs for the specified surah.
  /// 
  /// [surahNumber] must be between 1 and 114.
  Future<List<Ayah>> getAyahsBySurah(int surahNumber);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be concise** - Say what's necessary, no more
2. **Use examples** - Show, don't just tell
3. **Document why** - Explain reasoning, not just what
4. **Keep updated** - Update docs with code changes
5. **Use proper grammar** - Professional documentation
